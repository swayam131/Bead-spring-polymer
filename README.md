# Bead-spring-polymer
The project is useful in finding three-dimensional structure of chromatin from HiC contact map using Bead-spring polymer model.
To create data file from HiC contact map data: the python script 1 craete a straight-polymer chain where initial molecule coordinates are saved and the python script 2 use the HiC contact matrix data to create the bond data for lammps input.
For Bead-spring polymer simulation: The lammps input data and data file are for simulation to find three-dimnsional structure of given 2D HiC conatct map.
